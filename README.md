# Welcome to Matteo's GitHub

## About this space

Here you can find some repos I've created. Repos whose name starts with *sandbox* or *notes* are for *learning and trying* purposes only
(and probably are not super tidy 💨).

| Repository       | Description   | Focus on      |
| ------------- | :---: | ------------- |
| `sandbox-react-spa`  | A simple SPA made with React and deployed to Vercel | React, CRA, Styled-Components, Vercel |
| `sandbox-static-deployment`  | Trying out ES modules and set up a basic deployment | ES modules, Vercel |
